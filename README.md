# Julia

This repository is intended for Julia experiments and implementations related to convolution and image processing.

It was created to host the work and exploration I’m doing with Julia, starting with convolution techniques applied to images.

As the project grows, more functions, examples, and utilities will be added.

---

## Purpose

This repo exists to:

- Collect Julia code focused on image processing  
- Demonstrate convolution-related implementations  
- Serve as a personal reference for ongoing work

---

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and work in your preferred Julia environment.  
Example usage and code will be added here as the project develops.
